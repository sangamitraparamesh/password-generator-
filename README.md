### 📝 Pattern Guide (Optional)

You can define a password format using:

| Symbol | Meaning          |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| L      | Lowercase letter |
| U      | Uppercase letter |
| N      | Number           |
| S      | Symbol           |

Example:
`LUNS` → one lowercase, uppercase, number, symbol (total 4 characters)
If length is more than pattern size, the rest will be random.

| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0–50 bits   | Weak — Not secure            |
| 50–80 bits  | Medium — Acceptable          |
| 80–128 bits | Strong — Good for most cases |
| 128+ bits   | Very Strong — Highly secure  |
